# Appvalon

## What is Appvalon?

Online implementation of popular social deduction game, The Resistance: Avalon. Appvalon was built as a hackathon project at Pandora (because we played it a lot before COVID), so we could continue playing during quarentine :). Front end was built with create-react-app!

## Developing on Appvalon

Additional docs/info/stuff in `docs/`

- Running entire app: `yarn start`
